# Issues and Goals

At ENSTA Bretagne, France, student must spend twelve weeks abroad for studying reasons \(e.g. academic exchange, internship\). I choose to spend these three months during the internship of my first year of master. I was applying for internship in European Union without result until M. Jaulin had sent a mail with an offer for an internship at Tampere University of Technology in Tampere, Finland. The initial goal was to create and to develop a ROS implementation for the BlueRov2 because the USV was automated with ROS, and so at the end it will easier to link the two systems. At the same time the UAV uses ROS too. 

Jose V. Escusol, doctoral student working on the USV was interested of having students from ENSTA Bretagne for the development of the BlueRov2 because there is a video of the BlueRov2 from the ENSTA Bretagne youtube channel. Unfortunately I was not aware of this video but the academic program of the year was enough to start the project.
